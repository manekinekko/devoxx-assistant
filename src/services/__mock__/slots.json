Business analysts and domain experts describe how the application should behave using Gherkin (given-when-then) feature stories. Developers glue those specifications to automated tests.\r\nCan we use this approach when testing the integration of services, too?

This year, we are going to take you with us on a journey to create and develop your first decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain. Setting up your development environment, developing your first smart contract, unit testing it, deploying it to various instances of the chain, creating a user interface for your app, you will do it all."

In 2017, the company will process over $100 billion in transaction volume for tech, retail, airlines and gaming companies worldwide. \r\n\r\nFrom over a decade of scaling infrastructure, Michiel will share insights into how to make sustainable decisions in building system architecture with zero downtime, with practical approaches on topics such as how to avoid Zombie Bugs, dealing with release day Merge Hell , and the risks of being overcome by scale of deployments. In addition, Michiel will also discuss how to choose your technology stack wisely - while the temptation may be there to have the shiniest and most advanced tools, low maturity and not having the right skill set to manage your stack will quickly become a devops nightmare.

   "summary": "The introductory session, “Modules in One Lesson,” assumed an ideal world in which applications are constructed solely from modules, but that is not the world in which we live today.  How do we get there from here?  In this session we’ll live-code a simple Java 8 application that uses some popular libraries and then modularize it with Java 9.  We’ll see how Project Jigsaw and the Java Platform Module System give you the ability to migrate to modules at your own pace, even if the libraries upon which you depend have not yet been modularized."

After this session you should only have to take hours, instead of days or weeks to pinpoint performance issues in your apps."

In this talk we will discuss 3 key aspects that matter the most for us as (possible) cloud developers: support, documentation and ease of integration. I will bring to the table my experience with IBM Bluemix and I encourage you to share your own (regardless of PaaS used). The scope of this talk is to create a meaningful  \"lessons learned\" session  to help avoid common roadblocks."

A lot of software development and products involve the use of personal data and this falls under the GDPR. Developers and software companies not aware of what the GDPR stands for, may risk heavy fines if the software they write is non-compliant. This is not a scare session. In this session we will walk through what the GDPR is, what it affects and what not, and what steps people should take to be on the way to being compliant. I promise to keep the legal jargon to a minimum."

In the new sandbox environment, we removed the Java security sandbox and the classes whitelist; this allows developers to use all features in the JVM and still being protected within a secure environment. \r\n\r\nApp Engine can now support powerful frameworks like Spring Boot, Dropwizard with all the Java 8 language features. Best of all, you can run any JVM languages, including Groovy & Kotlin.\r\n\r\nWe'll show you how to use Kotlin end-to-end to build from an Android mobile client and also the backend with Kotlin & Spring Boot that can be quickly deployed and capable of scaling from 0 to infinity."
