He was instrumental in bringing the Activiti BPM engine to market (of course, the engineers maintain it was their hard work). Before that, there were a couple of start-ups, plus time with Documentum, Resumix and IBM. All after a spell in academia with an AI group, somehow blagging a PhD in the process.  In his spare time, he enjoys sprint and marathon kayaking.",

After one year without enough sleep, he decided to keep his day-job in the bank and re-focus, grudgingly, to SOA.\nLuckily, in 2015, REST made his journey from the Silicon Valley to the world of big companies, such as Banks, allowing Patrice to work back on web APIs during his day-job!</p>\n",

  "bio": "Patrice Krakow is currently the lead architect of the new API Platform of ING.\r\nHe starts focusing on integration 20 years ago, going through various technologies such as EDIFACT, X12, SGML, CORBA, DCOM, XML, SOA, ESB, before reaching REST APIs.\r\nIn 2012, he joined ING to participate in the implementation of an SOA Architecture. But, he also continued to explore new technologies during his ‘night-shift’, and co-founded an API company based in the Silicon Valley, Eligible. After one year without enough sleep, he decided to keep his day-job in the bank and re-focus, grudgingly, to SOA.\r\nLuckily, in 2015, REST made his journey from the Silicon Valley to the world of big companies, such as Banks, allowing Patrice to work back on web APIs during his day-job!",
